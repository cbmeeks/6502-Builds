Sample Programs
----------------

1. hello.prg

  When loaded at address $0300, this program will print "Hello, 6502 World!" in
  infinite loop.

2. echo_poll.prg

  When loaded at address $0300, this program will echo back to the console
  anything typed.


Both hello.prg and echo_poll.prg were assembled with the Ophis assembler:

3. echo_irq.rom

  This is another echo program, and behaves identically to echo_poll.prg,
  except it is interrupt-driven.

4. ehbasic.rom

   This is Lee Davison's Enhanced 6502 BASIC.

   To use this ROM image, just copy the file 'ehbasic.rom' into the directory
   where you run Symon. Rename the file to 'rom.bin'.  When you start Symon,
   the ROM file will be automatically loaded at address $d000.

   Click the "Run" button and EhBASIC should automatically start running.

   Type 'C' to do a cold start.

   Then, type $C000 when prompted for the memory size.

   NOTE: EhBASIC only wants upper-case input. This confused me at first!

   More information can be found in the 'ehbasic' directory, and by visiting
   the EhBASIC web page:
